I learned  return  function  is a value that a function returns to the calling script or function when it completes its task. A return value can be any one of the four variable types: handle, integer, object, or string. The type of value your function returns depends largely on the task it performs.



I learned FizzBuzz which is a programming language for a interview for developers.


I also learned that function return, which is function that calls script or function when completes its task. It could be one of the fallowing: handle, integer, object, or string.
